\title{Bayesian estimation of a Structural Vector Autoregression
with traditional and narrative sign restrictions via Gibbs sampler}
\usage{
\method{estimate}{BSVARSIGN}(specification, S, thin = S, show_progress = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{specification}{an object of class BSVARSIGN generated using the \code{specify_bsvarSIGN$new()} function.}

\item{S}{a positive integer, the number of posterior draws to be generated}

\item{thin}{a positive integer, specifying the frequency of MCMC output thinning}

\item{show_progress}{a logical value, if \code{TRUE} the estimation progress bar is visible}
}
\value{
An object of class PosteriorBSVARSIGN containing the Bayesian estimation output and containing two elements:

 \code{posterior} a list with a collection of \code{S} draws from the posterior distribution generated via Gibbs sampler containing:
 \describe{
 \item{A}{an \code{NxKxS} array with the posterior draws for matrix \eqn{A}}
 \item{B}{an \code{NxNxS} array with the posterior draws for matrix \eqn{B}}
 \item{hyper}{a \code{5xS} matrix with the posterior draws for the hyper-parameters of the hierarchical prior distribution}
 \item{skipped}{an integer of the total skipped iterations,
 the Gibbs sampler performs a total of S+skipped iterations,
 when the sampler does not find a valid rotation matrix \code{Q} within \code{max_tries},
 the current iteration is skipped (i.e. the current draw of \code{A,B} is not saved).
 A message is shown when skipped/(skipped+S/thin) > 0.05, where S/thin is the total number of draws returned.
 }
}

\code{last_draw} an object of class BSVARSIGN with the last draw of the current MCMC run as the starting value to be passed to the continuation of the MCMC estimation using \code{estimate()}.

\description{
Estimates Bayesian Structural Vector Autoregression model
using the Gibbs sampler proposed by Waggoner & Zha (2003) with traditional sign restrictions 
following Rubio-Ramírez, Waggoner & Zha (2010) and narrative sign restrictions 
following Antolín-Díaz & Rubio-Ramírez (2018). Additionally, the parameter matrices \eqn{A} and \eqn{B}
follow a Minnesota prior and generalised-normal prior distributions respectively with the matrix-specific
overall shrinkage parameters estimated using a hierarchical prior distribution. 

Given sign restrictions, in each Gibbs sampler iteration, the sampler draws rotation matrix 
\eqn{Q} uniformly from the space of \code{NxN} orthogonal matrices and checks if the sign restrictions
are satisfied. If a valid \eqn{Q} is found within \code{max_tries} (defined in \code{specify_bsvarSIGN}),
the sampler saves the current \eqn{A} and \eqn{B} draw and proceeds to the next iteration.
Otherwise, the sampler then proceeds to next iteration without saving the current \eqn{A} and \eqn{B} draw.
If a narrative sign restriction is given, the posterior
draws are resampled with \code{algorithm 1} in Antolín-Díaz & Rubio-Ramírez (2018).

See section \bold{Details} for the model equations.

\details{
The Structural VAR model is given by the reduced form equation:
\deqn{Y = AX + E}
where \eqn{Y} is an \code{NxT} matrix of dependent variables, \eqn{X} is a \code{KxT} matrix of explanatory variables, 
\eqn{E} is an \code{NxT} matrix of reduced form error terms, and \eqn{A} is an \code{NxK} matrix of
autoregressive slope coefficients and parameters on deterministic terms in \eqn{X}.

The structural equation is given by
\deqn{BE = U}
where \eqn{U} is an \code{NxT} matrix of structural form error terms, and
\eqn{B} is an \code{NxN} matrix of contemporaneous relationships. More specifically,
\deqn{B = Q'P}
where \eqn{Q} is an \code{NxN} rotation matrix and \eqn{P} is an \code{NxN} lower triangular matrix.

Finally, the structural shocks, \code{U}, are temporally and contemporaneously independent and jointly normally distributed with zero mean and unit variances.
